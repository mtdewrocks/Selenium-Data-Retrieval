# Selenium-Data-Retrieval

These are two sample scripts that I have used to download and extract zipfiles for use in other analysis. The drought shapefile script is set up to run weekly on the Windows Task Scheduler, and the shapefile is used within a Tableau dashboard. The Texas Wells data was a project I saw posted on Upwork that I decided to create even though I was not selected for the project.
